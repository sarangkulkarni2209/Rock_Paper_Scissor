# Rock_Paper_Scissor

This project is a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes a basic user interface with buttons for each choice (rock, paper, scissors), and upon user selection, it randomly generates the computer's choice and displays the game result (win, lose, or tie) on the webpage. The code structure involves HTML for the markup, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for handling user input and game logic.
